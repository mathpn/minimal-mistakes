> This is the part 2 of a series, please read [part 1](http://hyperspaces.org/sentiment-classification-twitter-part1/) before reading this.

We'll use Recurrent Neural Networks to classify the [Sentiment140](http://www.sentiment140.com) dataset into positive or negative tweets. Previously, [we used a Bag of Words followed by a logistic regression classifier](http://hyperspaces.org/sentiment-classification-twitter-part1/). This approach, however, completely ignores the semantic relationship between words as it only consider the count of each word in a tweet. Thus, we aim at considering the **position of words and its complex relationships** to achieve better classification.

## Pre-processing

The exact same pre-processing steps will be used:

```python
import re
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

data = pd.read_csv('training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv', encoding = 'ISO-8859-1', header = None)
data.columns = ['sentiment','id','date','flag','user','tweet']
```


```python
def preprocess_tweets(tweet):
    tweet = re.sub(r"([A-Z]+\s?[A-Z]+[^a-z0-9\W]\b)", r"\1 <ALLCAPS> ", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub('((www\.[^\s]+)|(https?://[^\s]+))','<URL> ', tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r"/"," / ", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub('@[^\s]+', "<USER>", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub('[^A-Za-z0-9<>/.!,?\s]+', '', tweet)
    tweet = re.sub('(([!])\\2+)', '! <REPEAT> ', tweet)
    tweet = re.sub('(([?])\\2+)', '? <REPEAT> ', tweet)
    tweet = re.sub('(([.])\\2+)', '. <REPEAT> ', tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r'#([^\s]+)', r'<HASHTAG> \1', tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r'(.)\1{2,}\b', r'\1 <ELONG> ', tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r'(.)\1{2,}', r'\1)', tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r"'ll", " will", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r"'s", " is", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r"'d", " d", tweet) # Would/Had ambiguity
    tweet = re.sub(r"'re", " are", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r"didn't", "did not", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r"couldn't", "could not", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r"can't", "cannot", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r"doesn't", "does not", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r"don't", "do not", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r"hasn't", "has not", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r"'ve", " have", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r"shouldn't", "should not", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r"wasn't", "was not", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub(r"weren't", "were not", tweet)
    tweet = re.sub('[\s]+', ' ', tweet)
    tweet = tweet.lower()

    return tweet
```
This time, however, we'll split the data into train, test and validation sets. The **validation** set is used to **monitor overfitting during training**. The test set should be left untouched and unseen until its evaluation. It may sound counter-intuitive, but merely tweaking the model according to the validation set performance may produce indirect overfitting (indirect as the model never sees any of the validation data) and may jeopardize its generalization capability (that is, its ability to perform well in data other than what it was trained on).

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

train_data, test_data = train_test_split(data, train_size = 0.8, random_state = 42)

sentiment = np.array(data['sentiment'])
tweets = np.array(data['tweet'].apply(preprocess_tweets))

sentiment_train = np.array(train_data['sentiment'])
tweets_train = np.array(train_data['tweet'].apply(preprocess_tweets))

sentiment_test = np.array(test_data['sentiment'])
tweets_test = np.array(test_data['tweet'].apply(preprocess_tweets))

train_data, val_data = train_test_split(train_data, train_size = 0.9, random_state = 42)

sentiment_train = np.array(train_data['sentiment'])
tweets_train = np.array(train_data['tweet'].apply(preprocess_tweets))

sentiment_val = np.array(val_data['sentiment'])
tweets_val = np.array(val_data['tweet'].apply(preprocess_tweets))
```

Just like in the previous post, we'll count word occurrences and establish a parsimonious threshold. Words below this threshold will be replaced by the *OUT* tag. This way, we limit model complexity while retaining most of information (more than 95% of word occurrences). Next, we build a word2int dictionary that assigns an integer value to each word in our dictionary. *PAD*, *OUT*, *EOS* and *SOS* tokens are also included in the dictionary. However, the *end-of-sentence* (EOS) and *start-of-sentence* (SOS) ended up not being used on this model.

```python
word2count = {}
for tweet in tweets:
    for word in re.findall(r"[\w']+|[.,!?]", tweet):
        if word not in word2count:
            word2count[word] = 1
        else:
            word2count[word] += 1

total_count = np.array(list(word2count.values()))

print(sum(total_count[total_count > 75]) / sum(total_count))

threshold = 75
words2int = {}
word_number = 0
for word, count in word2count.items():
    if count > threshold:
        words2int[word] = word_number
        word_number += 1

tokens = ['<PAD>', '<OUT>', '<EOS>', '<SOS>']

for token in tokens:
    words2int[token] = len(words2int) + 1

int2word = {w_i: w for w, w_i in words2int.items()}

print(len(words2int))
```

    0.9551287692699321
    9983

Thus, our final dictionary contains 9983 unique entries. Let's convert all of our tweets into series of integers according to our dictionary:

```python
tweets_train_int = []

for _tweet in tweets_train:
    ints = []
    for word in re.findall(r"[\w']+|[.,!?]", _tweet):
        if word not in words2int:
            ints.append(words2int['<OUT>'])
        else:
            ints.append(words2int[word])
    tweets_train_int.append(ints)

tweets_val_int = []

for _tweet in tweets_val:
    ints = []
    for word in re.findall(r"[\w']+|[.,!?]", _tweet):
        if word not in words2int:
            ints.append(words2int['<OUT>'])
        else:
            ints.append(words2int[word])
    tweets_val_int.append(ints)

tweets_test_int = []

for _tweet in tweets_test:
    ints = []
    for word in re.findall(r"[\w']+|[.,!?]", _tweet):
        if word not in words2int:
            ints.append(words2int['<OUT>'])
        else:
            ints.append(words2int[word])
    tweets_test_int.append(ints)


tweets_int = tweets_train_int + tweets_val_int + tweets_test_int
```
Our recurrent neural network receive inputs of fixed length. Therefore, our sequences will be padded (the *PAD* token will be added to the beginning of every tweet until it reaches our fixed length). Again, some tweets are extremely long due to repetitions and excessive punctuation. As a parsimonious length, the 99th percentile of all lengths was chosen, that is, 99% of all tweets will fit in our maximum padding length. Tweets longer than this will be truncated at the maximum length.

```python
lens = []
for i in tweets_int:
    lens.append(len(i))

max_len = int(np.quantile(lens, 0.99))

print(max_len)
```

    34



```python
from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

pad_tweets_train = pad_sequences(tweets_train_int, maxlen = max_len, value = words2int['<PAD>'])
pad_tweets_val = pad_sequences(tweets_val_int, maxlen = max_len, value = words2int['<PAD>'])
pad_tweets_test = pad_sequences(tweets_test_int, maxlen = max_len, value = words2int['<PAD>'])

sentiment_train[sentiment_train == 4] = 1
sentiment_test[sentiment_test == 4] = 1
sentiment_val[sentiment_val == 4] = 1
```
## Building our Neural Network

A [research paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8141873) suggests that a **combination of 1D convolutions with recurrent units result in a higher performance** than both of these alone. Thus, we built a neural network with an architecture inspired by this research paper.

Neural networks cannot make sense of the dictionary-labeled integers for each word, so a one-hot-encoded vector is passed as its input. That is, each word becomes a **9983-dimensional vector** with all values set to 0 except one: the corresponding word is the set to one. This data structure is **extremely sparse** and would require a staggering amount of trainable parameters. Thus, a word embedding is included as a first layer to the model.

An embedding is a form of dimensionality reduction. In the one-hot-encoded vector, every word is independent of all others, as each word has a single exclusive dimension for representation. In an embedding, each word is represented as a vector in a **n-dimensional space**, where **n is much smaller than the number of words**. This way, **words are dependent on each other** and, in a good embedding, **semantically similar words lay closer in the embedding space**. In our model, the embedding will be 200-dimensional. Learning how to embed words is not a simple task and many models use pre-trained embeddings. However, as our data consists of tweets, which contain many typos and idioms, I first wanted to use a untrained embedding, which is trained simultaneously with the model.

After the embedding layer, two parallel networks exist: one is a series of **three 1D convolutions** that can master relationships between adjacent words (remember that the words will be represented as a vector containing its meaning laying in a 200-dimensional space); the other path is a **two-layered recurrent neural network composed of GRU units**. GRUs are fairly recent, they are easier to train than the classic LSTM units (as they have fewer parameters) and often result in similar performance. Thus, I wanted to give the still young GRU a try.

A quite large dropout (0.5 rate) is used after the GRU layers as recurrent neural networks easily overfit. This rate is still smaller than the one suggested on the paper (0.7), although they used LSTM units.

**The model architecture is represented on the scheme below:**

![model_architecture](/assets/images/sentiment140/architecture1.png){: .align-center}

Keras functional API must be used due to parallel layers. The result of both 1D convolutions and GRUs is concatenated and followed by a 1-unit output dense layer. The Adam optimizer with soft weight decay will be used.

```python
import keras
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Conv1D, GRU, Embedding, Activation,\
BatchNormalization, concatenate, Input, GlobalAveragePooling1D
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from keras.models import Model

inputs = Input(shape = (34,), dtype = 'int32')

emb = Embedding(9983, 200, input_length = 34)(inputs)
emb_drop = Dropout(0)(emb)

out1 = Conv1D(128, 3)(emb_drop)
out1 = BatchNormalization()(out1)
out1 = Activation('relu')(out1)
out1 = Conv1D(64, 4)(out1)
out1 = BatchNormalization()(out1)
out1 = Activation('relu')(out1)
out1 = Conv1D(64, 3)(out1)
out1 = BatchNormalization()(out1)
out1 = Activation('relu')(out1)
out1 = GlobalAveragePooling1D()(out1)
out1_drop = Dropout(0)(out1)

out2 = GRU(128, return_sequences = True)(emb_drop)
out2 = GRU(128)(out2)
out2_drop = Dropout(0.5)(out2)

out_main = concatenate([out1_drop, out2_drop])
out_main = Dense(1, activation = 'sigmoid')(out_main)

model = Model(inputs = inputs, outputs = out_main)

early = keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', min_delta=1e-3, patience=1, verbose=0, mode='auto', baseline=None, restore_best_weights=True)
board = keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs_paper', histogram_freq=0, batch_size=64, write_graph=True, write_grads=False, write_images=False, update_freq= 1280)
check = keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint('model_paper.weights.{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.4f}.hdf5', monitor='val_loss', verbose=0, save_best_only=False, save_weights_only=False, mode='auto', period=1)

model.compile(optimizer = Adam(lr = 1e-3, decay = 5e-6), loss = 'binary_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])

print(model.summary())
```

The model contains **2.3 million trainable parameters** and takes a fairly large time to train using a mid-performance CUDA-capable GPU. Extra dropout layers with the rate set to 0 (rendering their presence irrelevant) were added to possibly tweak dropout rates during training.

```python
model.fit(x = pad_tweets_train, y = sentiment_train,\
          validation_data = (pad_tweets_val, sentiment_val),\
          batch_size = 64, epochs = 20,\
          callbacks = [early, board, check])
```

    Epoch 1/20

After the third epoch, the model reached its best performance on the validation set. The EarlyStopping callback makes sure that this is the model that is kept under the *model* variable.

## Model Evaluation

```python
from copy import deepcopy as dc
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, f1_score

pred = model.predict(pad_tweets_test)
pred_label = dc(pred)
pred_label[pred_label > 0.5] = 1
pred_label[pred_label <= 0.5] = 0

auc = roc_auc_score(sentiment_test, pred)
f1 = f1_score(sentiment_test, pred_label)
print('AUC: {}'.format(np.round(auc, 4)))
print('F1-score: {}'.format(np.round(f1, 4)))
```

    AUC: 0.9231
    F1-score: 0.8452

The best AUC achieved with the bag of words approach was **0.8782**, showing that the positional information added in this model really boosts performance. Still, it was a very **mild improvement**. This is expected as improvements in performance get exponentially more expensive with better models.

As in the first part of this post series, the top false positives and false negatives are actually mislabeled data. Thus, we'll take a peek at random false positive or negative examples, without actually choosing the most "incorrect" ones.

* **True Positives**

```python
from random import sample

pos_indices = sentiment_test == 1
pos_predicted = (pred > 0.5).reshape((-1))
true_positives = pos_indices & pos_predicted

samples = sample(range(sum(true_positives)), 5)
print(tweets_test[true_positives][samples])
print(pred.reshape((-1))[true_positives][samples])

We can see that true positives and negatives are indeed positive and negative, respectively. It is worth mentioning one example from true positives ("*some writing, some dusting, and then work 59 with tricia!*") which is not obviously positive and, accordingly, received a lower probability. From the negatives, the tweet "*kittens are going soon. sad times. i love them too much*" remained almost uncertain to the model probably due to the "*i love them too much*" part.

Some false positives or negatives don't have an explicit feeling to them - e.g "<*user*> were gettin alot of rain. we must be getting yours!", "catching up on my reading. <*repeat*> twitter n bf break"; without the label, its hard to classify them (most likely because *emoji* information was lost, and so the model incorrectly classified them but with probabilities close to 0.5. Some other mistakes are actually mislabeled data (e.g. "okay, a bath is a must. and then studying! i really have no life.", "<user> so you hate me", "my eyes are red. should sleep but dnt feel like it, haha. lilee is sitting on my chair so i have to sit on my bed", "ahh, worried about tomorrow. <repeat> will they turn up. <repeat> ? haha" - they should be all true negatives).

There are, of course, some obvious mistakes, such as *"wii fit day 47. hang over prevented wii this morning. late night work meant i wasnt home til near midnight. 15 min walk then situps"* (incorrectly classified as a positive).

It's worth mentioning that the complex nature of our model gives it a black box nature. That is, **it's very hard to know why a tweet was classified in some particular way**. For example, the tweets "<*user*> not even in the land of ketchup, thats just wrong. did u ever try the ketchup fries?" (probability: 0.6687) and "<*user*> hi ryan! why you are getting so unfashionable lately?" (probability: 0.8097) were false positives, yet they can be classified as positives if we consider they're funny. Still, it's very far-fetched to assume that the model learned a sense of humor. It's also a mistery why the tweet "<*user*> thats okay. <repeat> it will take a couple hours of intense therapy to get over it, but ill manage somehow" was classified as a positive. Maybe because the person will manage it somehow, even though this might have (and probably has, in this context) a negative connotation.

Finally, it's perceivable that this model has a greater ability to detect sentiment without obvious words (such as *love*, *hate*, *pain*, *happy*). This is the major improvement from the bag of words approach.
